/**
 * First-load JavaScript budget (audit PR-45; the metric corrected here).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS, ON TOP OF THE TOTAL-BYTES BUDGET
 * -------------------------------------------------
 * CI already bounds the TOTAL client JS in `build/_app/immutable`. That number
 * answers "is the app growing?" but it cannot answer "what does a visitor pay
 * to open one page?" — and those two questions came apart badly in this app.
 * Before PR-45 the total was 622 kB and *every single page* pulled ~583 kB of it
 * on first load, because the skin registry (removed in v8) statically imported all five skins
 * (and each skin's barrel imported all eight of its pages). SvelteKit was
 * splitting per route exactly as designed; a barrel import upstream of the route
 * made the split worthless.
 *
 * WHAT IS MEASURED
 * ----------------
 * Each prerendered .html file names some modules — in `<link rel="modulepreload">`
 * tags and in its SvelteKit bootstrap. Those are the ENTRY POINTS. The browser then
 * has to fetch everything they `import` statically, transitively, before the page
 * can hydrate, whether or not the bundler bothered to preload-hint it. So the number
 * reported is the transitive **static** import closure of the modules the HTML names.
 * Dynamically imported chunks (`import(...)`) are excluded, which is the whole point:
 * they are not on the critical path.
 *
 * WHY THE CLOSURE, AND NOT JUST THE HTML LIST
 * -------------------------------------------
 * The first version of this script summed only what the HTML listed, assuming the
 * bundler preload-hints the entire critical path. No bundler guarantees that, and
 * it is not stable across bundlers: measured on this app, the HTML list misses
 * **810 bytes** under vite 5 (rollup) and **11,109 bytes** under vite 8 (rolldown),
 * which emits fewer hints for a flatter chunk graph. A metric that moves when the
 * bundler changes its hinting strategy cannot be used to compare two builds — it
 * credited a toolchain upgrade with a 24 kB win when the real figure was 14 kB.
 * Following the imports is bundler-independent.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/first-load-bytes.mjs [--dir build] [--limit BYTES] [--json]
 *
 * Exits 1 if the worst page is over --limit (when given).
